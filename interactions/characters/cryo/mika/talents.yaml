     **Mika is a Polearm support unit that focuses on increasing his team’s Attack Speed and Physical DMG while also offering healing. One of the most notable things about Mika is even without Constellations, he currently has the highest Attack Speed buff in the game; unfortunately, his Physical DMG buffs are quite lacking until C6 unless in a multi-target situation. That said, he is not resource-demanding to build, as he only requires ER and minor amounts of HP% to do his job.**
