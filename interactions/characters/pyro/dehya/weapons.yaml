      Dehyaâ€™s weapons depend on whether she is built for reaction or non-reaction damage. Non-reaction damage (on-field) focuses on ER%, CRIT%, and ATK%, while reaction damage (off-field) focuses instead on pure Elemental Mastery.\n\nHere I will list the main recommendations, from her signature weapon to the most freely accessible weapon. However, for a more complete idea of weapon rankings, please refer to the mastersheet included here, make a copy, and play with the filters to examine the relationships with buffs in more detail.
